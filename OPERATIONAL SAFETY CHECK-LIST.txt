    * A fire blanket must be quickly and easily accessible in case of personal injury where a fire extinguisher might be unsuitable. 
    * All combustible material and/or objects must be cleared from the immediate surrounding area of the still
    * The floor should be clear of all debris and dry to avoid risk of tripping and/or slipping.
    * First-aid kit must be present.
    * All domestic animals should be locked up and/or kept away from the operating environment for the duration of operation.

    EQUIPMENT CHECKS
